# Introduction

Sorry, due to the author's limited energy, we are unable to develop a mod that supports multiple loaders. Currently, we only support neoforge, and we estimate that it will be gradually supported in the future (but we cannot guarantee it)

This is a simple copper-based expansion module that provides more practical recipes, including various tools, armor and other items;

That's all ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª

maybe i will write a developer guide for this mod in the future, but i am too lazy to do it now
